      In 1152, Peebles was made a Royal Burgh by King David the 1st.
      <br>
      <br>
      One of the oldest buildings in Peebles, the Cross Kirk dates back to the 13th century
      and has existed almost as long as the town has been recognised a Royal Burgh. Originally
      a trinian priory which was built by order of King Alexander III due to the discovery of 
      relics of Saint Nicholas of Myrna.

      Another historical place of interest is Neidpath Castle. Dated to the late 1300s, Neidpath
      Castle is the resident royal building of the town and has been visited by such people as Sir
      Walter Scott and even Mary Queen of Scots. Regarded as a historical artifact of Peebles, the
      Castle slowly crumbled throughout the years but was restored to its former glory after the 1650s.
      Used against Cromwell in the mid-17th century, it is known as the strongest castle against 
      Cromwell along the Forth River. Some interesting facts include that the roof was originally flat,
      and that the current castle was built on the ground of an older ruin, dated to the late 12th century.
