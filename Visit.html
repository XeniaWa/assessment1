    <p>
      Another fantastic location if you fancy travelling a couple miles outside of town is <a class="Links" href="https://www.traquair.co.uk/">
      Traquair House,</a> the oldest inhabited house in Scotland. Fun for all the family, you can explore much of the old house,
      visited by 27 Scottish Kings and Queens and even try a go at the escape tunnel which runs down the left side of the house.
      A historical fact about Traquair is that, due to their family lineage of Stuart's, the Bear Gates, the gates at the end of
      the garden which are by the entrance of the visitor attraction, have not been opened since the last Stuart sat upon the throne
      of Scotland, and will remain closed unless another Stuart sits upon the throne.
