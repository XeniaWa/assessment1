# Navigation
- At the beginning it was difficult to navigate through all the different types of code that 
  exists within html and css, but I figured it out and it is an enjoyable language to learn and 
  use.
- I wanted to make the website easy to navigate so I added a navigation bar at the top and a 
  picture of the crest so that you can easily go back onto the index page or the other pages.

# Layout
- I wanted to make the layout readable and eye-catching to the user rather than to fill it with 
  writing and information. I made sure to make the headings large enough so that they can be 
  easily read and made sure that the layout is constant and symmetrical.

# Colour Choices
- I decided to stick with colours represented in my town's crest and made them slightly 
  brighter and deeper to make the website more eye catching.
- I made sure that the colours wouldn't clash to avoid an annoying interface.

# Challenges
- I found it difficult to add bootstrap to my website as the link stopped the rest of my css from 
  working. I will look into it following this project and in future will add the link to bootstrap 
  at the beginning of the creation of my websites.
